## üéØ **Getting Started**

This section will help you get the app running in minutes.

### **1. Launch the Application**

Bolt is a modular platform. You can access different tools by opening the specific interfaces:

* `research-assistant.html`: For all AI-driven research tasks.
* `medical-exams.html`: For clinical data analysis and health monitoring.
* `training-plans.html`: For creating and managing athlete training programs.

### **2. Connect Your AI Engine (Required)**

To unlock the AI capabilities, you need to connect your Google Gemini API key.

* **Get Your Key:** Obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
* **Add it to Bolt:** In the research assistant interface, find the field labeled "API Key" and paste your key there.
* **(Optional) PubMed API Key:** For more advanced medical literature searches, you can add a PubMed API key.

### **3. Explore the Core Modules**

* **AI Research Assistant:** Brainstorm ideas, analyze data, and draft papers.
* **Medical Dashboard:** Visualize and interpret medical and physiological data.
* **Performance Analysis:** Compare athletes and predict matchup outcomes.

   * Three innovative research ideas based on your topic.
   * A list of simulated scientific articles to inspire you.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
> The articles generated in this step (titles, authors, abstracts) are **fictional and for inspirational purposes only**. They are designed to simulate real research and help you brainstorm. **DO NOT** cite them as real sources. Always validate findings with real, peer-reviewed literature via the PubMed integration or other academic databases.

2. **Save Your Ideas:** Use the **`Copy Ideas`** button to easily paste the generated content into your notes.

### **Step 3: Analyze & Interpret Data**

1. **Input Your Data:** Paste your raw data, summaries, or experimental results into the data analysis field.
2. **Run Analysis:** Click **`Analyze Data`**. The AI will process your input and provide:
   * Three key insights hidden in your data.
   * Two actionable optimization strategies.
   * Suggested next steps for your research.

### **Step 4: Refine & Communicate Your Work**

1. **Submit Your Text:** Paste a draft abstract, research proposal, or any other text.
2. **Get AI Feedback:** The AI will act as your writing partner, offering:
   * Three concrete suggestions for improvement.
   * A concise, one-sentence summary of your text.
   * An assessment of its potential originality.

### **Step 5: Create a Professional Report**

1. **Generate PDF:** Click **`Generate PDF Report`**.
2. **Download:** The system automatically compiles all the content from your session into a polished PDF document, named after your research topic.

## üè• **Medical Examination Dashboard**

Monitor athlete health with a clean, intuitive interface for complex medical data.

### **Dashboard Overview**

The dashboard is organized into clear sections for quick assessment:

* **ü´Ä Cardiology:** Track real-time heart health, including ECG, QT interval, ST segment, and blood pressure trends.
* **üß¨ Lab Results:** Analyze blood work and metabolic panels, from hematology and biochemistry to hormone levels (testosterone, cortisol) and nutrition (vitamins, minerals).
* **ü¶¥ Physical Assessment:** View key performance indicators like anthropometry (body composition), flexibility, strength, and endurance metrics.

### **How to Use the Dashboard**

1. **View Details:** Click any metric card to expand it. You'll see detailed data, historical trends, and color-coded indicators (green for normal, red for abnormal).
2. **Generate Reports:** Export data from a single test or create a comprehensive health summary to share with athletes or healthcare providers.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Athlete Performance Analysis**

Leverage AI to gain a competitive edge by comparing athletes and identifying key performance gaps.

### **Athlete Comparison Tool**

1. **Select Athletes:** Use the search bar to choose two athletes to compare.
2. **Analyze the Matchup:**
   * **Statistics:** An objective, side-by-side comparison of key performance metrics.
   * **Prediction:** An AI-powered analysis of a potential matchup, highlighting probable outcomes.
   * **Similarity:** An overall score rating how closely matched the athletes are.

## üé® **Pro Tips & Best Practices**

### **Workflow Efficiency**

* **Tabbed Browse:** Keep the research, medical, and training interfaces open in separate browser tabs to switch between them seamlessly.
* **Document Everything:** Regularly use the `Copy` buttons and generate PDF reports. Think of the app as your workspace, but your external documents are your permanent archive.
* **Start Broad, Then Go Deep:** Use the AI to explore general topics first, then use its suggestions to narrow your focus and conduct specific PubMed searches.

### **Validate AI Results**

The AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for professional judgment.

* **Cross-Reference:** Always verify AI-generated insights against peer-reviewed literature.
* **Consult Experts:** Discuss all medical and training recommendations with qualified healthcare professionals and coaches.

## üö® **Troubleshooting & Support**

### **Common Issues & Fixes**

* **AI Features Not Working?**
  * ‚úÖ **Check API Key:** Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly pasted.
  * ‚úÖ **Check Internet:** AI features require an active internet connection.
  * ‚úÖ **Refresh Page:** A simple refresh (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`) often solves temporary glitches.

* **Slow Performance?**
  * ‚úÖ **Close Tabs:** Too many open tabs can consume system resources.
  * ‚úÖ **Clear Cache:** A cluttered browser cache can slow things down.

### **How to Get Help**

1. **Check the Console:** Press `F12` to open your browser's developer tools and click on the "Console" tab. Look for red error messages‚Äîthey provide valuable clues.
2. **Use a Modern Browser:** Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge with JavaScript enabled.

## üîê **Privacy & Security**

Your data privacy is paramount.

* **Local-First Processing:** Most data and all your activity remain within your browser. The platform is designed to be stateless.
* **Secure API Calls:** Communication with AI services like Google Gemini is encrypted.
* **No Cloud Storage:** The Bolt platform **does not** store your research, API keys, or personal information on any server.
* **User Control:** You are in complete control of your data.

### **Security Recommendations**

1. **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do not input personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI).
2. **Guard Your API Keys:** Treat your API keys like passwords. Do not share them publicly.
3. **Use Secure Computers:** When using a public or shared computer, always use incognito mode and close the browser when you are finished.
